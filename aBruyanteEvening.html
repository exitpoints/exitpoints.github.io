  # A Bruyante Evening

  ### Next edition: August 6, 10 pm

  
  Bi-weekly on Thursdays, 10 pm (between 30 and 60 minutes)
  Live on Twitch @ www.twitch.tv/abruyanteevening, Bilingual evening (English and French)
  Get a drink and come see our experiments! 
  
  A Bruyante Evening is a space for sound experiments, open to everybody that wants to explore different ways to improvise together from various non sound sources. It is a way to connect the many different artists and performers I know and admire, and get their mediums mixed together, to create unexpected bounds, to challenge the way we create and opened up to new ways of creating sound. It is an invitation to explore your own practice in experimental context, to push the frontier of your comfort zone. 
  
  Performers are invited to meet on a common ground, a non sound based inspiration (an image, a painting, live visual creation, creative prompts, tarot reading, etc.), to improvise under certain given rules (mostly about time, limitations, and sometime challenges). Parameters and inspirations are given ahead, along with some tools for performers to prepare to it. Time is taken at the end of the improvisation(s) to discuss the experience, live and then off-stream, to try to identify how the inspirations and parameters affected, both in positive and negative ways, the performers and the group.
